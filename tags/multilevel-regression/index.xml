      <description>For starters, here&amp;rsquo;s the Stan code. And here&amp;rsquo;s the R script: Stan code. If you are already familiar with RStan, the basic concepts you need to combine are standard multilevel models with correlated random slopes and heteroskedastic errors.
I will embed R code into the demonstration. The required packages are lavaan, lme4 and RStan.
I like to understand most statistical methods as regression models. This way, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand the claims underlying a large number of techniques.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in the relationship between ordinal regression and item response theory (IRT) for a few months now. There are several helpful papers on the topic, here are some randomly picked ones 1 2 3 4 5, and a book.6 In this post, I focus on Rasch analysis. To do any of these analyses as a regression, your data need to be in long format - single column identifying items (regression predictor), single column with item response categories (regression outcome), and column holding the person ID.</description>
