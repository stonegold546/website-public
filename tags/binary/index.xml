      <description>So I don&amp;rsquo;t listen to the Quantitude podcast. It&amp;rsquo;s really difficult for me to get into it when my playlist includes podcasts with episodes titles like: Interstellar Jihad. However, I saw several tweets inspired by the SEM vs. regression episode. And I have too many thoughts, opinions, feelings to stay quiet. I lay them out here.
   SEM is regression A case of cultural differences The actual difference is LISREL But too much LISREL, not enough measurement error LISREL works well for normal-data normal-model no manifest covariates models Covariance matrix -&amp;gt; LISREL likely fails with discrete indicators LISREL likely fails for SEMs with observed covariates (e.</description>
