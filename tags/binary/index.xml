      <description>So I don&amp;rsquo;t listen to the Quantitude podcast. It&amp;rsquo;s really difficult for me to get into it when my playlist includes podcasts with episodes titles like: Interstellar Jihad. However, I saw several tweets inspired by the SEM vs. regression episode. And I have too many thoughts, opinions, feelings to stay quiet. I lay them out here.
 SEM is regression So this is pretty much established and known by methodologists.</description>
