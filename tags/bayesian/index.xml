      <description>I was listening to Frank Harrell on the Plenary Sessions podcast talk about Bayesian methods applied to clinical trials. I&amp;rsquo;d recommend anyone interested in or considering applying Bayesian methods listen to the episode.
One thing I liked was their discussion on communicating the evidence for practical significance in a transparent way. They were talking about how a paper they had read had a very good example of this. The episode doesn&amp;rsquo;t have notes so I did not see the paper.</description>

      <description>For starters, here&amp;rsquo;s the Stan code. And here&amp;rsquo;s the R script: Stan code. If you are already familiar with RStan, the basic concepts you need to combine are standard multilevel models with correlated random slopes and heteroskedastic errors.
I will embed R code into the demonstration. The required packages are lavaan, lme4 and RStan.
I like to understand most statistical methods as regression models. This way, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand the claims underlying a large number of techniques.</description>
