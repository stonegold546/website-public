      <description>When I first came across the recent preprint by McNeish and Gordon Wolf on Twitter on how sum scores are factor scores from a heavily constrained model, my first reaction was: don&amp;rsquo;t we all know this already? Sacha Epskamp asked the same question and there&amp;rsquo;s a discussion that follows about how people who study these topics know this, but applied researchers may not.
I skimmed the paper and the authors show how sum scores are factor scores when all item error variances are the same and all loadings are the same across items.</description>
