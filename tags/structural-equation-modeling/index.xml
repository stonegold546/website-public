      <description>So I don&amp;rsquo;t listen to the Quantitude podcast. It&amp;rsquo;s really difficult for me to get into it when my playlist includes podcasts with episodes titles like: Interstellar Jihad. However, I saw several tweets inspired by the SEM vs. regression episode. And I have too many thoughts, opinions, feelings to stay quiet. I lay them out here.
 SEM is regression So this is pretty much established and known by methodologists.</description>

      <description>TLDR: If you can assume close fit for the RMSEA, there is no reason why you cannot for a Chi-Square test in SEMs. The method to do this is relatively simple, and may cause SEM practitioners to reconsider the Chi-Square test.
 When assessing the fit of structural equation models, it is common for applied researchers to dismiss the $\chi^2$ test because it will almost always detect a statistically significant discrepancy between your model and the data, given a large enough sample size.</description>

      <title>Misspecification and fit indices in covariance-based SEM</title>

      <description>TLDR: If you have good measurement quality, conventional benchmarks for fit indices may lead to bad decisions. Additionally, global fit indices are not informative for investigating misspecification.
 I am working with one of my professors, Dr. Jessica Logan, on a checklist for the developmental progress of young children. We intend to take this down the IRT route (or ordinal logistic regression), but currently, this is all part of a factor analysis course project.</description>
