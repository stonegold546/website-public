      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the minorbsem package in R since the start of February. It&amp;rsquo;s my first proper attempt at an R package. The package allows you fit Bayesian SEMs while accounting for:
the possibility that minor factors influence the correlation between items (Uanhoro, forthcoming), or adventitious error (Wu &amp;amp; Browne, 2015). One can also fit meta-analytic SEMs under similar assumptions (Uanhoro, 2022).
The package is hosted on both GitHub and r-universe.</description>

      <description>There is a non-pay-walled version below, but the version of record is available at the Structural Equation Modeling, http://www.tandfonline.com/10.1080/10705511.2022.2142128.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the PDF and OSF repository with simulation and data analyses code in R.</description>

      <title>Traditional SEM overly focuses on LISREL equations to the detriment of dealing with measurement error</title>

      <description>So I don&amp;rsquo;t listen to the Quantitude podcast. It&amp;rsquo;s really difficult for me to get into it when my playlist includes podcasts with episodes titles like: Interstellar Jihad. However, I saw several tweets inspired by the SEM vs. regression episode. And I have too many thoughts, opinions, feelings to stay quiet. I lay them out here.
SEM is regression A case of cultural differences The actual difference is LISREL But too much LISREL, not enough measurement error LISREL works well for normal-data normal-model no manifest covariates models Covariance matrix -&amp;gt; LISREL likely fails with discrete indicators LISREL likely fails for SEMs with observed covariates (e.</description>

      <title>A Chi-Square test of close fit in covariance-based SEM</title>

      <description>TLDR: If you can assume close fit for the RMSEA, there is no reason why you cannot for a Chi-Square test in SEMs. The method to do this is relatively simple, and may cause SEM practitioners to reconsider the Chi-Square test.
When assessing the fit of structural equation models, it is common for applied researchers to dismiss the $\chi^2$ test because it will almost always detect a statistically significant discrepancy between your model and the data, given a large enough sample size.</description>

      <title>Misspecification and fit indices in covariance-based SEM</title>
      <link>https://www.jamesuanhoro.com/post/2017/10/28/misspecification-and-fit-indices-in-covariance-based-sem/</link>

      <guid>https://www.jamesuanhoro.com/post/2017/10/28/misspecification-and-fit-indices-in-covariance-based-sem/</guid>
      <description>TLDR: If you have good measurement quality, conventional benchmarks for fit indices may lead to bad decisions. Additionally, global fit indices are not informative for investigating misspecification.
I am working with one of my professors, Dr. Jessica Logan, on a checklist for the developmental progress of young children. We intend to take this down the IRT route (or ordinal logistic regression), but currently, this is all part of a factor analysis course project.</description>
