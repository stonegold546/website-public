      <description>There is a non-pay-walled version below, but the version of record is available at the Structural Equation Modeling, http://www.tandfonline.com/10.1080/10705511.2022.2142128.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the PDF and OSF repository with simulation and data analyses code in R.</description>

      <description>TLDR: If you can assume close fit for the RMSEA, there is no reason why you cannot for a Chi-Square test in SEMs. The method to do this is relatively simple, and may cause SEM practitioners to reconsider the Chi-Square test.
When assessing the fit of structural equation models, it is common for applied researchers to dismiss the $\chi^2$ test because it will almost always detect a statistically significant discrepancy between your model and the data, given a large enough sample size.</description>

      <title>Misspecification and fit indices in covariance-based SEM</title>

      <description>TLDR: If you have good measurement quality, conventional benchmarks for fit indices may lead to bad decisions. Additionally, global fit indices are not informative for investigating misspecification.
I am working with one of my professors, Dr. Jessica Logan, on a checklist for the developmental progress of young children. We intend to take this down the IRT route (or ordinal logistic regression), but currently, this is all part of a factor analysis course project.</description>
