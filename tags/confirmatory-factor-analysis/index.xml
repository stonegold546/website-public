      <title>When data are not so informative, it pays to choose the sum score over the factor score</title>

      <description>When I first came across the recent preprint by McNeish and Gordon Wolf on Twitter on how sum scores are factor scores from a heavily constrained model, my first reaction was: don&amp;rsquo;t we all know this already? Sacha Epskamp asked the same question and there&amp;rsquo;s a discussion that follows about how people who study these topics know this, but applied researchers may not.
I skimmed the paper and the authors show how sum scores are factor scores when all item error variances are the same and all loadings are the same across items.</description>

      <description>For starters, here&amp;rsquo;s the Stan code. And here&amp;rsquo;s the R script: Stan code. If you are already familiar with RStan, the basic concepts you need to combine are standard multilevel models with correlated random slopes and heteroskedastic errors.
I will embed R code into the demonstration. The required packages are lavaan, lme4 and RStan.
I like to understand most statistical methods as regression models. This way, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand the claims underlying a large number of techniques.</description>

      <title>A Chi-Square test of close fit in covariance-based SEM</title>

      <description>TLDR: If you can assume close fit for the RMSEA, there is no reason why you cannot for a Chi-Square test in SEMs. The method to do this is relatively simple, and may cause SEM practitioners to reconsider the Chi-Square test.
 When assessing the fit of structural equation models, it is common for applied researchers to dismiss the $\chi^2$ test because it will almost always detect a statistically significant discrepancy between your model and the data, given a large enough sample size.</description>

      <title>Misspecification and fit indices in covariance-based SEM</title>

      <description>TLDR: If you have good measurement quality, conventional benchmarks for fit indices may lead to bad decisions. Additionally, global fit indices are not informative for investigating misspecification.
 I am working with one of my professors, Dr. Jessica Logan, on a checklist for the developmental progress of young children. We intend to take this down the IRT route (or ordinal logistic regression), but currently, this is all part of a factor analysis course project.</description>
