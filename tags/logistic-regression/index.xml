      <title>Should you perform logistic regression on a dichotomized continuous variable when you have access to the continuous variable? I&#39;m not sure.</title>

      <description>A standard situation in education or medicine is we have a continuous measure, but then we have cut-points on those continuous measures that are clinically/practically significant. An example is BMI where I hear 30 matters. You may have an achievement test with 70 as the pass score. When this happens, researchers may sometimes be interested in modeling BMI over 30 or pass/fail as the outcome of interest. The substantive question often falls under the lines of modeling the probability of someone exceeding/falling short of this clinically significant threshold.</description>

      <description>I have read that the most common model for analyzing ordinal data is the cumulative link logistic model, coupled with the proportional odds assumption. Essentially, you treat the outcome as if it were the categorical manifestation of a continuous latent variable. The predictor variables of this outcome influence it in one way only, so you get a single regression coefficient for each predictor. But the model has several intercepts representing the points at which the variable was cut to create the observed categorical manifestation.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in the relationship between ordinal regression and item response theory (IRT) for a few months now. There are several helpful papers on the topic, here are some randomly picked ones 1 2 3 4 5, and a book.6 In this post, I focus on Rasch analysis. To do any of these analyses as a regression, your data need to be in long format - single column identifying items (regression predictor), single column with item response categories (regression outcome), and column holding the person ID.</description>
