      <description>This is my first (first author) journal article. We started writing it in Summer 2018, with first submission by November 2018. So my thinking has changed somewhat since then. There is a non-pay-walled version below, but the version of record is available at the Journal of Experimental Education, http://www.tandfonline.com/10.1080/00220973.2019.1693328. The best part of the review process was communicating with the editor, Professor Brian French - he was very kind.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the PDF and GitHub repository with simulation and figure reproduction code in R (very little comments).</description>
