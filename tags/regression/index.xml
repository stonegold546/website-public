      <description>For starters, here&amp;rsquo;s the Stan code. And here&amp;rsquo;s the R script: Stan code. If you are already familiar with RStan, the basic concepts you need to combine are standard multilevel models with correlated random slopes and heteroskedastic errors.
I will embed R code into the demonstration. The required packages are lavaan, lme4 and RStan.
I like to understand most statistical methods as regression models. This way, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand the claims underlying a large number of techniques.</description>

      <title>Possibility of heteroskedasticity is a good reason not to dichotomize a continuous variable for use as outcome in logistic regression.</title>

      <description>Continuing on whether it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to dichotomize continuous variables prior to analysis for substantive reasons, I think I settle on the side of bad idea. The major reason is potential heteroskedasticity of the error term in the linear regression model for the original continuous variable.
This is an interesting issue, but one that I do not want to devote time to write about. So I decided to write a brief methods note.</description>

      <title>Should you perform logistic regression on a dichotomized continuous variable when you have access to the continuous variable? I&#39;m not sure.</title>

      <description>See here for an update, I recommend not dichotomizing, but it pays to read this first.
A standard situation in education or medicine is we have a continuous measure, but then we have cut-points on those continuous measures that are clinically/practically significant. An example is BMI where I hear 30 matters. You may have an achievement test with 70 as the pass score. When this happens, researchers may sometimes be interested in modeling BMI over 30 or pass/fail as the outcome of interest.</description>

      <title>Two group mean and variance comparisons</title>

      <description>Someone asked an interesting question on Cross Validated recently about comparing the means and variances of two groups. They had a substantive interest in exploring variance and mean differences between two groups. They were thinking about Shapiro-Wilk test to test the data for normality, Levene&amp;rsquo;s test or F-test for variance comparisons depending on the results of Shapiro-Wilk, and Mann-Whitney or Welch&amp;rsquo;s test for means comparisons depending on the Shapiro-Wilk.</description>

      <title>Simulating data from regression models</title>

      <description>My preferred approach to validating regression models is to simulate data from them, and see if the simulated data capture relevant features of the original data. A basic feature of interest would be the mean. I like this approach because it is extendable to the family of generalized linear models (logistic, Poisson, gamma, &amp;hellip;) and other regression models, say t-regression. It&amp;rsquo;s something Gelman and Hill cover in their regression text.</description>

      <title>Theil-Sen regression in R</title>

      <description>TLDR: When performing a simple linear regression, if you have any concern about outliers or heterosedasticity, consider the Theil-Sen estimator.
 A simple linear regression estimator that is not commonly used or taught in the social sciences is the Theil-Sen estimator. This is a shame given that this estimator is very intuitive, once you know what a slope means. Three steps:
 Plot a line between all the points in your data Calculate the slope for each line The median slope is your regression slope  Calculating the slope this way happens to be quite robust.</description>

      <title>Linear regression with violation of heteroskedasticity with small samples</title>

      <description>TLDR: In small samples, the wild bootstrap implemented in the R hcci package is a good bet when heteroskedasticity is a concern.
 Today while teaching the multiple regression lab, I showed the class the standardized residuals versus standardized predictor plot SPSS lets you produce. It is the plot we typically use to assess homoskedasticity. The sample size for the analysis was 44. I mentioned how the regression slopes are fine under heteroskedasticity, but inference $(t, SE, pvalue)$ may be problematic.</description>

      <title>On the interpretation of regression coefficients</title>

      <description>TLDR: We should interpret regression coefficients for continuous variables as we would descriptive dummy variables, unless we intend to make causal claims.
 I am going to be teaching regression labs in the Fall, and somehow, I stumbled onto Gelman and Hill&amp;rsquo;s Data analysis using regression and multilevel/hierarchical models.1 So I started reading it and it&amp;rsquo;s a good book.
A useful piece of advice they give is to interpret regression coefficients in a predictive manner (p.</description>
