      <description>I was listening to Frank Harrell on the Plenary Sessions podcast talk about Bayesian methods applied to clinical trials. I&amp;rsquo;d recommend anyone interested in or considering applying Bayesian methods listen to the episode.
One thing I liked was their discussion on communicating the evidence for practical significance in a transparent way. They were talking about how a paper they had read had a very good example of this. The episode doesn&amp;rsquo;t have notes so I did not see the paper.</description>
