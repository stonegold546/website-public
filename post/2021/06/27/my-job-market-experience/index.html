<main>
<p>I was on the job market this last year and ended up with a faculty job. I think it&rsquo;s worth sharing aspects of my process, so maybe someone learns something from it.</p>
<p>Prior to entering the job market, I decided two things.</p>
<ol>
<li>I would not be a postdoc unless it was a postdoc to faculty position: I have moved around for school since age 10 when I went to boarding school. I am now almost 30 and I&rsquo;m done with that.</li>
<li>I would be happy with a non-tenured job. There are very few faculty positions. I have only one published lead author paper. I cannot reconcile these facts with resolving to land a faculty position without being a postdoc. Also, whatever job I land would be much better than the conditions most human beings on this planet live under.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second resolution made the job market a very tolerable experience. I am also very low on anxiety relative to most grad students I&rsquo;ve met here. My idea of rock bottom is based on some extreme conditions in Nigeria. Given this baseline, I&rsquo;m almost always personally &ldquo;good&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I applied to seven jobs, all in the field of quantitative studies in education and psychology. Again, I did not have to get a faculty position, so I rarely stretched myself. Of the seven positions I applied to, there was only one I had no business applying to as I had none of the specific expertise they desired.</p>
<p>I could have applied to a few data science positions. I think I can do them, but little in my formal doctoral training suggests I can. So I told myself search committees would find much better candidates for those roles and did not apply.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t apply to some positions because I missed deadlines, or sometimes, I did not feel like putting in that work. Again, I did not have to get a faculty position. I will be fine, not going to stress over shit like this when I understand what fellow Nigerians are going through back home.</p>
<p>I crafted some job market materials based off materials a tenure-track friend shared with me. My advisor and partner helped with my statements. I don&rsquo;t think anyone else read my diversity statement - I knew what I wanted to say and I said it. With each new application, I moved things around a little to fit the different applications.</p>
<p>Of the seven applications, I had four first stage interviews. I had a prep session with my advisor for these interviews. And I think the interviews went well. I got invited to two &ldquo;virtual on-campus&rdquo;, but I had already accepted a position when I received the second invite.</p>
<p>The on-campus was quite difficult because I did not know what to expect. Thankfully, there is a new professor in my department who thinks very clearly about the different stages of job searching. I shared my itinerary with him, he made annotations and then we spent hours on Zoom discussing each meeting. This was particularly helpful for my meeting with the chair and dean. So I walked into each meeting well prepared. If you want to talk with him, hmu - he&rsquo;s open.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, most PhDs who want faculty jobs will not get them. If you are anything like me, the important thing is to make job searching tolerable. Life is every moment lived, not some future utopia. So I&rsquo;m not going to spend my time toiling on shit like this when I don&rsquo;t have to. So prepare for the market, but if you feel you&rsquo;re losing your mind, remember it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Chances are your PhD gives you access to many other options.</p>
